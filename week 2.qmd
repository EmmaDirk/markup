## Introduction 

Dear all, 

Welcome to `Quarto` - If you already know `rMarkdown`, it will be a breeze. If you don't know `rMarkdown` yet or if you feel that you need a refresher, please follow [this `Get Started`](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) guide.  For all others, we have outlined a couple of relevant links and videos to get a quick grasp on reproducible academic publishing with `Quarto`. 

All the best, 

The teaching team

## Preparation

### Watch this video
Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel has a great video that highlights many of Quarto's relevant features in our field.

### Browse the `Quarto` website
The people at `Posit` have designed [this awesome companion website](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) that details pretty much everything `Quarto`. Have a look around and remember this source when you're in need of some additional functionality. Much of what you can do with `Quarto` is detailed here.

## Exercise 1

Create a quarto presentation with 3 slides and a logo

Bring this presentation to the next class.

## Exercise 2

Create a presentation about any topic you like that consists of at least 7 slides and includes all of the following:

- a logo
- a centered still figure
- an interactive table
- a moving figure, interactive figure or movie
- a 2-column slide
- an aligned multi-row equation
- a citation and reference list
- a bibliographic reference
- r-code, displayed but not executed
- cached and labeled r-code (may overlap with the next requirement)
- r-code, executed, but not displayed (e.g. a figure generation)
- an `renv` reproducible enviroment

Of course this presentation may serve as the basis for presentations that you may have to create for other courses. Submit the presentation to your fork of [the deliverables template](https://github.com/hanneoberman/markup_deliverables/tree/dev). If you have not yet forked the template, do so now.
